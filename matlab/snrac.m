%Function r = snr(sig, nois)
%
%The function SNR computes the signal to noise ratio w.r.t. the
%average power of the signals, which is defined as:
%  r = 10 * log ( sum((sig(i))^2) / sum((nois(i))^2) ),
%where m_sig and m_nois are the mean values of sig and nois.
%
%
%ARGUMENTS: sig      - nx1 vector of n signal samples
%           nois     - nx1 vector of n noise samples
%
%RETURNS  : r        - signal-to-noise ratio in dB
